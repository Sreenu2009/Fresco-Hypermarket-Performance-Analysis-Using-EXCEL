# Fresco Hypermarket Performance Analysis

## üìå Project Overview
This project analyzes the performance of **Fresco Hypermarket** using Excel.  
The dataset contained order details such as timestamps, delivery areas, product amount, discounts, delivery charges, and completion status.  
I enriched the dataset by creating **new calculated columns** using advanced Excel formulas and then performed **pivot table‚Äìbased analysis** to answer 20+ business questions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Completion Rate Analysis
- **Overall completion rate = 99.55%** (22,721 delivered out of 22,823 orders).  
- Very high fulfillment efficiency, but the **0.45% gap** suggests small scope for improvement.
